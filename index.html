          <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
          <img src="images/ada.jpeg" alt="preview unAvailable">
          <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, better knoAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, better known as Ada Lovelace, was a British mathematician and writer who is recognized as the world's first computer programmer. She was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England, to a famous poet, Lord Byron, and his wife, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke.wn as Ada Lovelace, was a British mathematician and writer who is recognized as the world's first computer programmer. She was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England, to a famous poet, Lord Byron, and his wife, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke.
          <br>
          Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was born Augusta Ada Byron, the only legitimate child of Annabella Milbanke and the poet Lord Byron. Her mother, Lady Byron, had mathematical training (Byron called her his 'Princess of Parallelograms') and insisted that Ada, who was tutored privately, study mathematics too - an unusual education for a woman
          <br>
          As a woman in science, Ada Lovelace faced many challenges and obstacles. During her time, women were not generally encouraged to pursue intellectual pursuits and were often excluded from educational opportunities and scientific communities.
          Despite these challenges, Ada Lovelace was able to develop her mathematical skills and become a leading thinker in the field of computer science. She was mentored by the famous mathematician and inventor, Charles Babbage, who recognized her talent and encouraged her to pursue her ideas. 
          Lovelace's most significant achievement was her work on the Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer designed by Babbage. Lovelace was able to see beyond the simple calculation of numbers and imagine the potential of computing to create new forms of art and music. She also recognized that computers could be used for more than just number-crunching, envisioning the use of computing for scientific research, engineering, and even military strategy.       
          Lovelace's legacy as a woman in science is significant, and she remains a role model for women who aspire to careers in STEM fields. Her achievements paved the way for other women in science, and her work continues to inspire and influence the development of new technologies today.

          <h1>Marie Curie</h1>
          <img src="images/marie.jpeg" alt="preview unAvailable">
          <p>Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-French physicist and chemist who is known for her pioneering work on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields.
            Marie Curie was born Maria Sk≈Çodowska in Warsaw, Poland. She received a general education in Poland and then went to Paris, where she studied at the Sorbonne. There she met Pierre Curie, who would become her husband and collaborator. Together, they studied radioactivity and discovered two new elements, polonium and radium. For their work on radioactivity, the Curies were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.
            After Pierre Curie's tragic death in a road accident in 1906, Marie Curie continued their research and became the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. She was awarded a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in 1911, for her discovery and isolation of radium and the development of its medical applications.
            Throughout her career, Marie Curie faced significant obstacles due to her gender, including discrimination and exclusion from scientific organizations. Despite these challenges, she remained committed to her research and her passion for science, and her achievements paved the way for future generations of women in science.
            Marie Curie's legacy continues to inspire and influence scientific research today. Her work on radioactivity laid the foundation for the development of nuclear physics and technology, and her commitment to scientific discovery and innovation remains an inspiration to scientists around the world.</p>

          <p>Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of DNA. Her work played a crucial role in the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, but she did not receive full credit for her contributions until many years after her death.

            Franklin was born in London and received her education in chemistry and physics at University of Cambridge. She went on to work at several prestigious institutions, including King's College London, where she conducted her groundbreaking work on the structure of DNA.
            
            At King's College London, Franklin used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of DNA, producing high-quality images that were crucial to the discovery of the double helix structure. However, her work was not fully recognized by her male colleagues, who later used her data to make their own discoveries without giving her proper credit. <br>

          <h1>Indira Gandhi</h1>
          <img src="images/indira.jpeg" alt="preview unAvailable">
          <p>Indira Gandhi (1917-1984) was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as the third Prime Minister of India, holding the office from 1966 until 1977, and again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was the first and only woman to hold the position of Prime Minister in India to date.

            Gandhi was born into a family of political leaders and became involved in politics at a young age. She served as a key advisor to her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, and played an active role in the Indian National Congress, one of the country's leading political parties.
            
            During her tenure as Prime Minister, Gandhi implemented a number of important social and economic policies, including the nationalization of banks and the establishment of a system of social welfare programs. She also played a leading role in India's foreign policy, seeking to strengthen the country's position on the global stage and promoting greater cooperation with other nations.
            
            Gandhi was a controversial figure and faced significant opposition during her time in office. She was accused of authoritarianism and of violating civil liberties, particularly during the period of emergency rule that she declared in 1975. Despite these criticisms, she remained a popular and influential figure in Indian politics until her death.
            
            Today, Gandhi is remembered as a pioneering figure in Indian politics and a symbol of women's empowerment in the country. Her achievements as India's first and only female Prime Minister have inspired generations of women to pursue careers in politics and to fight for greater representation and equality in the political sphere.
